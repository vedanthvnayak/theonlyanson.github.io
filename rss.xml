What's special about it?</title><link>https://theonlyanson.github.io/posts/arch-crazy/</link><dc:creator>Anson Sarosh Dsouza</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I have mentioned in my earlier blog, "BTW! I USE ARCH!". I tried lot of GNU/Linux distributions but finally settled upon Arch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might wonder why Arch is so popular?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always found Arch as a fascinating one, because from installing to managing, Arch lets you handle everything.
Arch lets you decide which desktop environment to use, which packages to install, and everything. This total control gives you a minimal operating system built upon your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Arch, you can have a better understanding of how Linux works. If you ever tried to install Arch, you know the complexity behind it.
But that complexity forces you to learn stuff that you never encounter in other distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you gain some interest in trying Arch by my thoughts, I'll leave you a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; which tell you how to install it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://theonlyanson.github.io/posts/arch-crazy/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 04:07:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Why I Use i3?</title><link>https://theonlyanson.github.io/posts/why-i-use-i3/</link><dc:creator>Anson Sarosh Dsouza</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I use i3 mainly because it saves a lot of time when I'm using my computer, I don't have to use my mouse most of the times.
I don't use mouse while closing or opening applications. I also don't think I automatically control my computer. Less hand movements so less frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also takes less resources thus no overhead on computer resources. I might use mouse while browsing, but I'm using tridctayl now. I will write a seperate blog on it later. Basically I dont have to use mouse while browsing, it makes browsing super flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very confusing at the beginning but I stuck with long enough and hence my muscle memory is trained. I hope you do the same too.
I'll leave a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx0eNaGzAZU"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to it incase you want to know more about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you next time :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://theonlyanson.github.io/posts/why-i-use-i3/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:21:39 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hello, I'm the only Anson ;)</title><link>https://theonlyanson.github.io/posts/hello-im-the-only-anson/</link><dc:creator>Anson Sarosh Dsouza</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Reader,&lt;/p&gt;
