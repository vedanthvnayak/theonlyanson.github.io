As I have mentioned in my earlier blog, "BTW! I USE ARCH!". I tried lot of GNU/Linux distributions but finally settled upon Arch.

You might wonder why Arch is so popular?

I have always found Arch as a fascinating one, because from installing to managing, Arch lets you handle everything.
Arch lets you decide which desktop environment to use, which packages to install, and everything. This total control gives you a minimal operating system built upon your choice.

With Arch, you can have a better understanding of how Linux works. If you ever tried to install Arch, you know the complexity behind it.
But that complexity forces you to learn stuff that you never encounter in other distributions.

If you gain some interest in trying Arch by my thoughts, I'll leave you a `link <https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/installation_guide>`_ which tell you how to install it.
