I use i3 mainly because it saves a lot of time when I'm using my computer, I don't have to use my mouse most of the times.
I don't use mouse while closing or opening applications. I also don't think I automatically control my computer. Less hand movements so less frustration.

It also takes less resources thus no overhead on computer resources. I might use mouse while browsing, but I'm using tridctayl now. I will write a seperate blog on it later. Basically I dont have to use mouse while browsing, it makes browsing super flexible.

It was very confusing at the beginning but I stuck with long enough and hence my muscle memory is trained. I hope you do the same too.
I'll leave a `link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx0eNaGzAZU>`_ to it incase you want to know more about it.

See you next time :)
